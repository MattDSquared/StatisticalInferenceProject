## Question
By looking at the R datasets package for ToothGrowth, determine vitamin C has a significant impact on tooth size in Guinea Pigs? 

## Project Setup

The original data set (as found by calling ?ToothGrowth from Rstudio) comes from a study by C. I. Bliss focusing on length of odontoblasts (teeth) in each of 10 guinea pigs at each of three dose levels of Vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg) with each of two delivery methods (orange juice or ascorbic acid).

```{r setup}
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr); library(dplyr)
data(ToothGrowth) # loads ToothGrowth data frame

# rename variables for plotting clarity
names(ToothGrowth) <- c("length","suppliment","dose")

# assign more clear suppliment labels
ToothGrowth$suppliment <- factor(ToothGrowth$suppliment, levels=c("OJ","VC"), labels=c("Orange Juice", "Ascorbic Acid"))

```

## Exploratory Analysis
Let's explore the data, what are the general trends in tooth length vs suppliment delivery method? Let's assume the underlying distribution is iid normally distributed. 

```{r exploratory}
ToothStats <- ToothGrowth %>% 
    group_by(suppliment,dose) %>%
    summarize(mean_length = mean(length), sd_length=sd(length), 
              lbound=mean_length-1.645*sd_length,
              ubound=mean_length+1.645*sd_length)

gg <- ggplot() +
    facet_grid(. ~ suppliment) +
    geom_point(data=ToothGrowth, 
               aes(x=dose,y=length, color=suppliment)) +
    geom_line(data = ToothStats, 
              aes(x=dose, y=mean_length, color=suppliment)) +
    geom_errorbar(data = ToothStats, 
                  aes(x=dose, ymin=lbound, ymax=ubound)) +
    geom_ribbon(data = ToothStats, 
                  aes(x=dose, ymin=lbound, ymax=ubound), 
                alpha=.3) +
    labs(title="Effect of vitamin C suppliments on Tooth Growth") +
    labs(x="Dosage Size [mg]") +
    labs(y="Tooth Length")
print(gg)
```
